## Fonts
- **Headings:** Montserrat (sans-serif)
- **Subheadings:** Roboto (sans-serif)
- **Body Text:** Lato (sans-serif)

**Rationale**:
- *Headings (Montserrat)*: Montserrat is a clean and simple sans-serif font that provides a strong and bold appearance for headings. This choice aims to make headings stand out and leave a lasting impression on the players.
- *Subheadings (Roboto)*: Roboto is a versatile sans-serif font that is easy to read and works well for subheadings. It ensures clarity and consistency in design, making subheadings easy to understand.
- *Body Text (Lato)*: Lato, another sans-serif font, is chosen for body text to ensure readability. Its simplicity and readability make it suitable for game instructions and descriptions, ensuring that players can easily follow the rules and guidelines.

These design choices aim to create an appealing and user-friendly Yatzy game interface, with a focus on clarity, trustworthiness, and excitement as well as friendliness through color accents. The combination of relaxing blue and success-associated green, along with carefully chosen fonts, will contribute to an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience.
